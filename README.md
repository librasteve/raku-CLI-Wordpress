# Raku CLI::Wordpress

This module provides a simple abstraction to the Wordpress command line interface (wpcli) for managing Wordpress installation.

If you encounter a feature of wpcli you want that's not implemented by this module (and there are many), please consider sending a pull request.

## Design
- install rawp on target
```zef install https://github.com/p6steve/raku-CLI-Wordpress.git```
- files
  - docker-compose.yaml 
  - nginx-conf
  - â€¦?
- qqx stages

###CMDs
- [ ] launch
- [x] start ```sudo docker-compose up -d```
- [x] stop ```sudo docker-compose down```
- [x] list ```sudo docker-compose ps```
- [x] connect ```sudo docker exec -it ubuntu_wordpress_1 "/bin/bash"```
- [x] terminate ```sudo docker compose down -v```  #rm volumes & reset
- [ ] exec #wpcli cmd

## Getting Started
- zef install https://github.com/p6steve/raku-CLI-Wordpress.git _[or CLI::Wordpress]_
- rawp _[enter your commands here]_

## Usage
```
./rawp <cmd>
  
    <cmd>         One of <launch start stop connect terminate>
```

##commands
###1. launch

This follows the advice on viz. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-docker-compose with a few exceptions:
- docker-compose.yaml
  - put in port 443 from the get go (even if not used)
  - certbot does not run a command on docker-compose up -d to avoid exceeding the (5/week) limit of let's encrypt, instead the cerbot image is started (and allowed to exit) when it can be re-run with the needed commands:
     - ```sudo docker-compose run certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/html --email steve@furnival.net --agree-tos --no-eff-email --staging -d furnival.net -d www.furnival.net``` (once on launch, eg. after termination)
     - ```sudo docker-compose run certbot renew --dry-run```
